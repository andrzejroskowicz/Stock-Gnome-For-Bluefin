# Stock-Gnome-For-Bluefin

It's a simple script that reverts some opinionated changes to Gnome by Bluefin devs. 
Changed values are taken from Gnome OS - available under https://os.gnome.org/

Scrip may need more changes as Bluefin provides more changes to the upstream. 
I plan to later provide a script that revert the reversion.
