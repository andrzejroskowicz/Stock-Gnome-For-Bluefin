# Stock-Gnome-For-Bluefin

It's a simple script I wrote for my own use, that reverts some opinionated changes to Gnome by Bluefin devs. 
Changed values are taken from Gnome OS - available under https://os.gnome.org/

Scrip may need more changes as Bluefin provides more changes to the upstream. 
Comes with restoreBluefinDefaults.sh -- run this to undo changes, now you can easily switch between the stock gnome and stock Bluefin!
